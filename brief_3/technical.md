Community of practice technical group
================

# Scope

The focus of this group will be *data visulaisation*. This is largely because its what many of us want (but not necessarily what we need). The intended outcomes are:

1. Additional skills in R in general and data visualisation in particular will be gained.
2. Networking between data professionals in health in South Australia will be imporved.
3. Skills and successes with data will be highlighted.

# In this space already

* Owen Churches coordinates the PublicSectR monthly meetup which includes a sprint through that weekâ€™s TidyTuesday dataset.
* Adelaide University's statistics specialisation runs a GentleR group each week for people to bring in their R related problems.
* The CAIN Lab at UniSA runs a weekly R group focused around reading the R4DS book.

# Venue and frequency

This will depend in part on the pathways we choose. 

# Pathways
Four sub-avenues could co-exist

1. A weekly meetup in which participants worked on the latest [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data set, shared their ideas, their code and their finished product. This would allow people to share analytic products without having to get approval to share work related data and insights. Mechanisms to fascilitate this could include:
* Real time screen sharing for designing and creating the visualisations using [Codebuddies](https://codebuddies.org/)
* Developing skills in using [GitHub](https://github.com/) to maintain code

2. A weekly meet up learning together group that could move sequentially through:
* [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
Then working through:
* [Agile Data Science with R](https://edwinth.github.io/ADSwR/)
* [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
* [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/)
* [Hands-On Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/)

Or enrolling together and supporting each other in external training such as
* [Coursera Data Science Specialization in R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)

3. Specific tutorial that could be condiucted live and live on-line for tasks that are particularly relevant to the health system in South Australia:
* Using [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) to automate reporting
* Accessing [databases](https://db.rstudio.com/getting-started/database-queries/) from R

4. A Slack workspace with channels for each of the above that acts as an ongoing support community answering technical question.

# Personel
Greer Humphrey and Owen Churches have begun work on a TidyTuesday group to design together and create a visulaisation and analytic product based on a novel data set each week.
